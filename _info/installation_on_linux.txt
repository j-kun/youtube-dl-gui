required programs:
	python
	youtube-dl
	libav

recommended non-standard python libraries:
	appdirs (pip install appdirs --user)
		[for OS specific location of log and config files]
	tk_tooltip (download from http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/ToolTip)
		[to display tooltips]

youtube-dl is available via apt-get but I would not recommend installing *youtube-dl* via apt-get because here it's crucial to have the newest version.
Instead follow the instructions on
http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html



move the folder youtube-dl-gui to whereever you want to have it and do the following.
(in the following examples I am it's located in /opt).

create an alias to call from the command line:
add the following line to ~/.bashrc:
alias youtube-dl-gui="python /opt/youtube-dl-gui/gui.py"

add it to Gnome menus:
create a link to the desktop-file:
$ ln -s /opt/youtube-dl-gui/youtube-dl-gui.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
